# Project overview

Covid-19 has caused severe economic consequences and markets to crash but through crises, there are opportunities. 

Which analyst reports should you trust? This project aims to validate analyst reports with a focus on Morningstar (a reputable investment research firm) and Yahoo Finance. Other analyst firms like Bloomberg and The Economist were considered but their analyses were either pay-to-access or too general to validate.
